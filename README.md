## Overview
Gets the list of all the standing for a given league id, country name and team name.

I used following tech-stack to build this application. 

1. Java 8
2. Spring boot v2.7.2

In addition to the above technologies I have used the following libraries - 

1. **Feign Client** - Feign is a declarative web service client. It makes writing web service clients easier.
2. **Controller Advice** - To handle both Runtime and custom application the exceptions in the application
3. **HATEOS** - Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS) is a constraint of the REST application architecture that distinguishes it from other network application architectures. With HATEOAS, a client interacts with a network application whose application servers provide information dynamically through hypermedia.
4. **Open API** - The OpenAPI Specification, previously known as the Swagger Specification, is a specification for machine-readable interface files for describing, producing, consuming, and visualizing RESTful web services.
5. **Spring Actuators** - Monitoring our app, gathering metrics, understanding traffic, or the state of our database become trivial with this dependency.
6. **Lombok** - I used lombok to avoid writing boilerplate code such as constructors, getter-setter etc.
